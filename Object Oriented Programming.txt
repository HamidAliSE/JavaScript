Pillars
01. Encapsulation: Hiding Internal Details
02. Abstraction: Identifying & Implementing Essential Features
03. Inheritance: Inheriting Shared Internal Details & Features From Parent To Child
04. Polymorphism: Different Implementations In Child Using Shared Internal Details & Features From Parent

Types Of Polymorphism
01. Compile Time: Achieved Through Method Overloading
02. Run Time: Achieved Through Method Overriding

Overloading
Methods in Same Class with Same Name but Different Parameters & Different Return Type (Not Possible in JS due to Dynamic Argument Types & its Lengths - Use Most Recent Implementations in JS)
Method in Sub Class with Same Name, Same Parameters (Not Same for JS) & Same Return Type
